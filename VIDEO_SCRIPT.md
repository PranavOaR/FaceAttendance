## **CHAPTER 5: TRAINING THE AI MODEL (5:00 - 6:00)**

### Visual: Navigate to Attendance Page
**Action: Click "Mark Attendance" button**
**Narration:**
"Now comes the exciting part - face recognition! Let's mark attendance for this class."

### Visual: Attendance Marking Page with Webcam Preview
**Narration:**
"This is the attendance marking interface. On the left, we have our webcam feed, and on the right, we can see all students in the class with their current attendance status."

### Visual: Highlight "Train Model" button
**Narration:**
"Before we can recognize faces, we need to train our AI model. This is a one-time process per class - or whenever you add new students."

### Action: Click "Train Model"
**Visual: Loading indicator with progress**
**Narration:**
"When we click 'Train Model', the backend starts processing each student's photo. Here's what happens behind the scenes:"

**Technical Breakdown (show with graphics):**
1. Photos are downloaded from Firebase Storage
2. Face detection using CNN model identifies faces
3. Face encodings are generated with 10x jittering for accuracy
4. Embeddings are stored in cache and Firebase

**Visual: Success notification**
**Narration:**
"Training complete! Our model now has learned to recognize all 4 students in this class. The model achieved this using a CNN-based face detection algorithm with 128-dimensional face encodings - quite sophisticated!"

---

## **CHAPTER 6: FACE RECOGNITION & ATTENDANCE (6:00 - 7:30)**

### Visual: Webcam feed active
**Narration:**
"Now for the main feature - automatic attendance marking! Notice I have manual scan control, which means I decide when to start and stop scanning."

### Action: Click "Start Face Scan"
**Visual: Scanning animation with detection overlay**
**Narration:**
"I'll click 'Start Face Scan'. The system now continuously scans the webcam feed every 2 seconds, looking for faces that match our trained students."

### Visual: Position first student in front of camera
**Narration:**
"Let me position the first student in front of the camera. Watch what happens..."

**Visual: Face detected, matched, confidence score shown**
**Narration:**
"Amazing! The system detected the face, matched it to our database, and automatically marked John Doe as present with 87% confidence. Notice how the student's status changed from 'Absent' to 'Present' in real-time."

### Visual: Position second student
**Narration:**
"Let's try another student... And there we go! Sarah marked present with 92% confidence. The live counter on the 'Stop Scan' button shows we've found 2 students so far."

### Visual: Show the Stop Scan button with counter
**Narration:**
"One of the best features I implemented is manual scan control. Instead of a fixed 30-second timer, YOU control when to stop scanning. This prevents false negatives and gives you complete control."

### Action: Click "Stop Scan"
**Visual: Scan complete notification**
**Narration:**
"I'll stop the scan now. The system has successfully recognized 2 out of 4 students. For the remaining students who weren't present, their status remains as 'Absent'."

### Visual: Show manual toggle option
**Narration:**
"If needed, you can manually adjust any attendance record by clicking on a student card. This is useful for correcting any errors or marking students who arrived late."

---

## **CHAPTER 7: ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS (7:30 - 8:15)**

### Visual: Split screen showing code and results
**Narration:**
"Let me highlight the accuracy improvements I implemented in this system."

**Key Features:**
1. **CNN Face Detection**
   **Narration:**
   "Instead of the basic HOG model, I use a Convolutional Neural Network for face detection, which provides 30% better accuracy especially in varying lighting conditions."

2. **10x Jittering**
   **Narration:**
   "The system uses 10x jittering when generating face encodings - this means it samples the face from slightly different angles 10 times and averages the results, making recognition much more robust."

3. **Stricter Threshold**
   **Narration:**
   "I lowered the recognition threshold from 0.6 to 0.5, meaning the system requires higher confidence before marking someone present. This dramatically reduces false positives."

4. **Image Enhancement**
   **Narration:**
   "Before processing, images are enhanced using CLAHE - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization - which improves face detection in poor lighting."

### Visual: Show configuration API endpoint
**Narration:**
"I even built a configuration API where you can adjust these parameters in real-time based on your specific needs."

## **CHAPTER 8: SAVING & REPORTS (8:15 - 9:30)**

### Visual: Back on attendance page
**Action: Click "Save Attendance"**
**Narration:**
"Once we're satisfied with the attendance records, we click 'Save Attendance'. This creates a permanent record in Firebase with the date, time, and attendance status for each student."

### Visual: Success message and redirect
**Narration:**
"The attendance has been saved and we're redirected back to the class page."

### Visual: Navigate to Reports section
**Action: Click "Reports" in navigation**
